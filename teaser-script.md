# The Evolve Room Podcast - Teaser Script
## Episode: "Zero-to-Solve: The Execution Layer Has Moved"
## Featuring: Steven Muir-McCarey

### [INTRO SOUND EFFECT: Modern tech transition with digital elements]

**Jamie:** G'day and welcome to The Evolve Room, LuminateCX's podcast exploring the cutting edge of technology and business transformation. I'm your host, Jamie Parker.

**Alex:** And I'm Alex Chen, joining Jamie to unpack the biggest shifts in tech and AI.

**Jamie:** On our next episode, we're diving into a mind-blowing concept called 'Zero-to-Solve' - where the execution layer in technology has fundamentally shifted.

**Alex:** We'll be joined by Steven Muir-McCarey himself, author of the thought-provoking article that's got tech leaders talking.

### [TRANSITION SOUND: Subtle tech whoosh]

**Jamie:** Steve, your article makes a bold claim - that while most businesses are still talking about AI disruption, the real shift has already happened. Can you give us the big picture?

**Steve:** The execution layer has moved. It's no longer buried in your dev backlog, delivery pipeline, or integration stack. It now lives at the edge, where intent meets outcome, instantly.

**Alex:** And this isn't just faster coding, it's a fundamental change in how solutions are conceived and delivered.

**Steve:** Exactly. We're in the Zero-to-Solve era: a world where business users, strategists, and domain experts don't just generate ideas, they deliver them. Not with dev tickets, but with AI-native tools that turn prompts into products, ideas into automation, and bottlenecks into velocity.

### [HIGHLIGHT SOUND: Subtle ping/notification]

**Jamie:** In the full episode, we'll explore how technologies like expanded context windows, reliable tool use, and multi-modal capabilities are enabling this shift.

**Alex:** Plus, we'll break down the practical impact through real-world examples like:

**Jamie:** The rise of citizen developers using platforms like Windsurf, Cursor, and Bolt.new

**Alex:** The emergence of agentic architecture where multiple AI agents work together on complex tasks

**Jamie:** And the new Model Context Protocol creating standardized ways for AI systems to interact

**Steve:** We're no longer building tools. We're building ecosystems. And ecosystems don't just scale, they compound.

### [TRANSITION SOUND: Technology transformation]

**Jamie:** We'll also discuss the challenges this creates for organisations:

**Alex:** Security concerns when execution becomes decentralized

**Jamie:** Governance questions when systems become more autonomous

**Alex:** And the shifting role of technical teams when business users can build solutions directly

### [CLOSING THEME BEGINS TO FADE IN]
