## Subject: The Execution Layer Has Moved: Join Us for a Game-Changing Tech Conversation

# THE BIG IDEA
**The most significant shift in AI isn't what everyone's talking about.**

While most teams chase AI disruption, the sharpest operators have moved on because the real disruption is already behind us.

# WHY IT MATTERS
The execution layer has moved from dev backlogs to the edge, where intent meets outcome instantly.

This fundamentally changes:
- How solutions are delivered
- Who builds them
- What's possible without code

# COMING APRIL 20
